# Task Master
## What is Task Master?
> Not the show, Task Master is a small solo project I have created for handling high workloads and managing tasks to be flexible and efficient. This software is predominantly based for University students that struggle with the workload, and can be used across a multiple courses.
> This project was made using Python and it's Tkinter Module. The code is of course open-source and feel free to do whatever you'd like with it :)
