# Task Master
## What is Task Master?
#### Not the show, Task Master is a small solo project I have created for handling high workloads and managing tasks to be flexible and efficient. This software is predominantly based for University students that struggle with the workload, and can be used across a multiple courses.
### Features include:
* Organising tasks by order.
* Adding priority to tasks to understand the importance of certain tasks.
* Adding time and date deadlines to tasks to ensure they are fufilled.
* Rewarding productivity with small rewards.
# Version 0.1
### Task addition has been added. Priority, deadline (still in work), task title, completion status and hidden reward claim have all been added to this build of the program, only in data structure. Task data structure has also been added. All files have been added to this repo too.
# Version 0.2 (Proposed features)
* Added in deadlines for tasks
* Adding a delete function for completed tasks
* Storing the tasks so they are not removed upon each launch
